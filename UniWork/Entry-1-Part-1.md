# Post One: Introduction and a Work Project

So here I am. After 11 years since I graduated from the University of Leicester with a BEng (Hons) in General Engineering, I'm back in the world of being a student. This time doing the User Experience (UX) Design MA at Falmouth University. To say I'm excited isn't entirely accurate, I'm also quite nervous. It's been so long since I've studied, I don't know how hard this is going to be.

I decided to start this degree to make myself the best Technical Author/Writer I can be. I'd say it's a career that is adjacent to the world of UX. I've been a Technical Author/Writer for just over a decade now, though my current role involves a lot of content design and architecture. So quite a bit of UX is involved now. I'm currently going through a lot of research to make software developer's experiences better with documentation tooling.

As part of reflecting and covering what I'm learning throughout the module, I thought it would be a good idea to cover one of the big project I'm doing at work. That way I can combine study and career, and reflect on what I'm doing at work and how I can improve on what I've done in the future.


## The Work Project

The project I'm doing at work is to take an existing internal wiki and find a better solution. When I joined the company, I started looking at the wiki that is currently used and, after listening to software developers, realised that the wiki isn't serving the needs of its users. Which are software developers in this case.









## The Project as it Stands

So a bit of background to the project, in bullet points to keep it concise: 

- The company has an internal wiki.
- The wiki is built using wiki.js.
- I've heard software developers complain about how they dislike the wiki.
- I pitched an idea to look at alternative tooling for a wiki site. It was accepted and here we are. 

That is a very concise summary of how this project came to life. It's been six months since I started this project, so I'll go through the timeline and highlight and blockers/problems I hit along the away.

## The Beginning

As mentioned, the tool currently in use is [wiki.js](https://js.wiki/). Considered one of the best wiki generators, I cannot disagree there. It is good... if it's implemented correctly, and you do not need a huge range of features. Wiki.js is quite deceptive in terms of ease of use. I don't have enough knowledge of the infrastructure side of wiki.js, but from what the company's Infra team has told me, it's awkward. So I'll take their word for it. 

With the project being accepted, I had to come up with a plan.

### Where to Start?

Surprisingly, it wasn't a difficult start to this project. I identified three key things I needed to do before I even considered an action plan.

1. Talk to the developers/engineers, learn their pain points and what they'd like from an internal wiki.
2. Analyse the existing tool, and become familiar with the pain points raised.
3. Research the existing tool - how often are updates released for the tool, how active is development.
