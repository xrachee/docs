Commentary on the mindless office drone who is expected to just go along with it | - Visuals take on a semi-realistic style, not directly what we’re going for but it works for appearing like a generic office

| Good Job! | Game set in an office, the objective is to progress through the floors by completing office tasks by any means that you can think of. This might be better off in the direct competitors section but it feels different to our puzzle-esque game. | - Art style is very cartoony, essentially looks like the Portal characters from their animated segments but in a normal office
- Ridiculous gameplay which gives players agency in deciding their way of completing the tasks, think akin to Scribblenauts where you could use the first idea that comes into your head | - Not many levels and looks like there isn’t much room for replayability
- Appears there isn’t much story behind it, there is an initial premise in terms of lore but outside of ‘starting from the bottom’ it doesn’t seem to follow any narrative | - Casual

- Quick pick up/put down game | https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Good-Job--1748054.html |  |
| The Talos Principle | Story driven, puzzle game, the player is given a story to follow throughout difficult puzzles, this isn’t a typical puzzler as it can take a player a while to solve each one, unlike the usual puzzlers where a player could get through a good handful of puzzles in a short amount of time. | - Excellent narrative, teeters on philosophical in terms of narrative
- The soundtrack is brilliant, it complements the rather barren world
- Stunning visuals | - Difficult, not for a casual gamer | - Experienced gamer

| Team Member | Research Take Aways/Comments |

| Megan | Currently a large market for cozy games (https://games-stats.com/steam/?tag=cozy) with games tagged as cozy bringing in significant revenue on Steam. Same goes as well for satire games (https://games-stats.com/steam/?tag=satire). Tag search on Steam shows very few results for a cozy/satire game. This could indicate an untapped market. 

Here is a great publication on the use of satire in video games to spark real world conversations and give social critiques (Rachel also posted this I realized in References as well): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342503333_'Is_This_a_Joke'_The_Delivery_of_Serious_Content_through_Satirical_Digital_Games |
| Rachel | Combination of hell and office based/corporate games is going to be a niche demographic to tackle. Some like for the hell-side to be either “in your face” or extremely subtle, there’s no in between. Office-based/corporate games that lean into satire need to lean heavily into it. The expectation appears to be that if you’re going to do an office-based game, it need to turn into The Office (either US or UK, and it has to stick to it).

Then combining it with the style/game design that comes with cozy games is really pushing our idea into an area that hasn’t been explored before. I think if we’re going to combine the three areas, we need to reference Hell in a light manner (characters with horns and little wings) but maintain a light colour palette that comes with cozy games. Office humour needs to be there from the get go. 

We need to ensure that the narrative includes optional quests Having a linear story with no deviation will be off-putting. Having divergence allows to incorporate more easter eggs for situations that would appear in the office or in other games (which is worth also leaning into as this is a game). 

To make it a point-and-click puzzle game, we’d need to utilise stories/mechanics that would let our users organically find the answers. The mechanics need to be enough to keep users engaged, but simple enough that they do not become overwhelmed with the experience. The majority of users could be using our game as an outlet after a stressful day at work, and to burden them with stressful gameplay would be counterintuitive. |
| Matt | There’s a few games that mix hell and offices, some try to lean more toward the office vibe like Red Tape, and some prefer to lean closer to the Hell vibe like Hell of an Office, we ideally want to try to find a balance that doesn’t lean more one way than the other.

When it comes to our game we want to be able to make it accessible to everyone, so best to avoid the massive puzzles like The Talos Principle, we’d want to look more toward Good Job! where the player is given a rough task and they solve it at their own pace, also toward the art style of the same game is something I’d lean toward, the simplicity of the style makes it easier to pump out a lot of assets in a short amount of time.

When it comes to the narrative surrounding the game, I’d like to see us use the Hell themes integrated into the office life, maybe have NPCs discuss the best soul they’ve seen down below, leaning into some satirical aspects, and someone has to be complaining about the heat and the fact that the AC doesn’t work. |

| Marine | The cosy game style we choose for our game makes it more accessible than RedTape, which can be a good business opportunity. Many young professionals are being disillusioned about their workplaces and our game will be the perfect place for them to have fun and laugh after a stressful day at work. 

Our characters need to have a subtle devil side, not so visible at first, like the “devil” people in their real office who look nice at first. The environment also needs to be in a light colour palette with comforting shapes for the pieces of furniture.

Note on Red Tape : I don’t like the aesthetics of it, too literal in my opinion. I think we can be more fun and subtle. If awful workplaces were as obvious as the game, people wouldn’t choose to work there. I think we should “hide” the hell beneath cute characters (Rachel - agreed, it looks awful, but is a direct competitor) |
