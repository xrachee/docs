# 30/5 Week 1: Webinar

1. Assigned supervisor. 
2. Artefact = a thing. Game/app/website. 

Aim: 

To help you **collaborate effectively**‚Ä¶ something, something.


Assessment ‚Äî> removed boring bits, ‚Äúmake the thing, and make the thing good‚Äù. 

- original and engaging artefact in response to a brief (1 brief UXD or 1 brief IGD, but can use your own). 
If making your own brief, cover it in the pitch video.
- Entertaining or useful artefact. 
‚Äî> Some people focus on one or the other.
- Clearly defined target audience.
- Supported by solid research.
- Artefact should then be demonstrated via a pitch video. 
‚Äî> 10 minute pitch video plus supporting materials.
- We define how often we meet the supervisor. Recommend to meet every two weeks.
- One activity is to write a team charter ‚Äî> agreement for what each team member works on.
- Upload the video to Panopto and include a link in the PDF.
- We may need to do an Ethics Form, depending on whether we test beyond the peer group. 
‚Äî> UX720 had to do Ethics Forms, so we know what to do.
- Artefact needs to be developed enough to pitch it.
Will look at examples to see how much we need to do.
- Give as much documentation as possible
    - Early prototype if you want.
    - Share whatever reinforces the artefact.
    - Pre-production and planning not so much, but it could be helpful.
    - Roadmaps could be good - simplified deliverables in slides, but documentation can be detailed.
    - User Research and market research are more suited to supporting materials instead of slide pitch.
- Not platform-specific, just make sure it can be recorded.
- Record in 16:9 if working on a different platform.
- Industry panel in Week 10 (most likely Thursday at 7pm) to present product to an industry expert. It‚Äôs optional.
- We‚Äôre staying away from kids üëÄ

## Previous Examples

- Mixed discipline groups.
- All games.

### Actions:

*The following will be migrated to [Kanban](https://www.notion.so/5723bea6c2874d63a259420924f4e891?pvs=21)*

    !https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/752070790308036668.webp?size=44&quality=lossless
    
- Creating a list of software + what versions (to avoid crashes and build breaks due to software updates) - added to Team Charter.

### Take aways

- 3D confirmed (mix of disciplines, Maya)
- Leaning more towards art than programming (considering peoples skill sets)
- Gamified - Matt and Callum preference for games.
In terms of skillset, more beneficial to make a game.
- Having 3 designers is beneficial to us.
- [Design Brief](https://www.notion.so/c64f0a3a3e16441986e998bb8bd35871?pvs=21) page created.
- Definition of ‚Äúcosy game‚Äù.
Non-competitive - but if there is a competitive aspect, it needs to be fun.
Resource management
Puzzlers
Slow-pace games
Singular and co-op play. 
No negative time aspect (rapid response)
Stardew Valley is the template for a cosy game.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Life 
Talos Principle
- Combat shouldn‚Äôt be the primary focus
- Try to steer away from heavy programming mechanics. Focus on 1-2 core mechanics.

## Meeting with Ken (Supervisor)

- Progress and rubric.
- Whiteboard in teams from Ken ‚Üí [GDO731 - Group 03](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/95de633a-083e-42f5-b444-a4295d8e9314/_djb2_msteams_prefix_3757443557?context=%7B%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A55a751052bc64fae9ed4750ebf390e32%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&tenantId=550beeb3-6a3d-4646-a111-f89d0177792e)
- Summary to Ken about what we‚Äôve done in Notion and Figjam.
- **Pitching** ‚Üí well organised and covering most important things. Tell the value of the product. Pitch it as if you‚Äôre selling the game.
    - Not just a simple presentation
    - tell about how the team works.
    - Make sure information shared is of value and is organised.
- Keep high **Product Execution**
    - How everyone contributes ‚Üí high team collaboration.
    - Contribution is more important
    - Do something that you‚Äôre more weak at to learn something
        - Show how there were opportunities to learn
- For **Product Innovation**, find streams that can bring both worlds together
    - Interaction design
    - E.g. Visual design ‚Üí this could be good as we‚Äôre focusing on the artwork.
    - Use this focus to make the game unique, tweak the principles.
    - Potential example ‚Üí using a finite set of colours, using only specific shapes. Finite interactions (point and click)
- Ken‚Äôs Specifications on meeting grading guidelines (Megan‚Äôs notes)
    - **Market Analysis (High Mark)**
        - Nail down our demographic
            - Market trends
            - Who is our user?
                - Education
                - Ability and needs
                - Available time (free time)
                - Persona
        - Market analysis should explain our design decisions and interaction mechanics
        - Our research should include strong justification about how it would be marketable to our chosen demographic
        
    - **Pitch Presentation (High Mark)**
        - Well organized
        - VALUE OF PRODUCT
            - Pitch should be similar to pitching to an investor
                - Why should they invest any money (strong market research and demographic justification)
                - Why is the product valuable to the chosen demographic (strong justification for why users would buy and continue to play this game)
                - Why is the team trustworthy for funding? What makes this team special or worth investing in? Ken noted including things about ourselves/why our team works well together (we should sell our team like a product)
                - Why we have done this project
                
    
    - **Product Execution (High Mark)**
        - Everyone needs to be learning things outside of their comfort zone and domain
            - Specifically working on weaknesses and THERE NEEDS TO BE TANGABLE DOCUMENTATION ON IT AND TANGABLE ARTEFACTS TO PROVE IT!
            - People should be actively thinking & planning about what they want to learn/push themselves out of their comfort zone. Document the learning journey for evidence!
            
    - **Product Innovation (High Mark)**
        - Pick one principle of UX and/or IGD and lean into that!
            - This could be visual, interactive, thematic, etc.
            - Lean deeply into this principle and push it to it‚Äôs limit = a unique game
            - We must be able to explain and justify the principle we picked and how it is showcased through our project (more of a note for including this into the pitch)

# 27/6 Week 5: Team Sync & Ken Meeting

- Created [New Things](https://www.notion.so/9c62feaa412b44dc9cdb5707d6c36f15?pvs=21) to record learning areas for each team member.

## Agenda

To talk to Ken:

- Market research, why are we doing what we‚Äôre doing
- Learning domain
- Art - what principle are we going for.
- Where the build is
- Where everyone is in terms of tasks (last two weeks since we talked to Ken)
- **Question: What to expect for pitch?**

## Covered Topics

- Discussed narrative

## Meeting with Ken

1. Showed Notion
    1. Kanban board. Showed that we‚Äôre adding priority.
    2. Showed market research - Rachel to turn into formal document. Really want to show that there is a market for cozy games (Animal Crossing, Unpacking etc.). Trackers on Steam to see share on tags - see how much money a genre makes. Humour/satire games has a big demographic that is getting bigger. More women playing cozy/casual games. Single-player, non-competitive. No real cozy/satire niche, so gives us a chance to distinguish ourselves. 
2. Talked about design principles - specifically focusing on a visual principle. Thinking of pushing for an overlap principle (focal point and wayfinding). Wayfinding to make progression visually obvious.
3. Colour palette - vivid colours, so thematic colours work well based on theme. 
4. People doing things outside their wheelhouse - [New Things to Learn](https://www.notion.so/9c62feaa412b44dc9cdb5707d6c36f15?pvs=21)
5. Narrative driven - need NPCs and interactions
6. Industry professionals in Week 8
7. Callum showed current build

## Ken Comments

**Pitching**

- elements/lists of things to show

Heavily focused on the **value** of what we‚Äôre doing. We need to remember the pitching time.

Need to make sure that we‚Äôre focusing on the right parts. 

Keep it focused on the pitching.

**Question: Week 8 Pitch**

- Is there a sign up?
- Order for pitching?
- Time limit?
- How is the pitch to be done?
- Is there a Q&A

Ken has no details at the moment, but will double check and will post on Teams.
