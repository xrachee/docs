## Team Charter and Supporting Files

### Part 1: Team Charter & Supporting Files

Throughout this module, participants will be tasked with researching and formulating a team charter. This document is intended to comprehensively outline the roles and duties assigned to each team member and other production details. All team members must sign the finalised charter.

You may also want to include in your submission documents related to the assignment:

- Research Documentation

The presentation of substantial market research supporting your project, including target audience analysis and competitor review. This research should be referenced in your video presentation, following the Harvard Referencing format.

- Target Audience Identification

The specification of the target audience for your pitch. This could be angel investors, game publishers, a government body, or representatives from a specific industry, among others.

Documents should be embedded in the PDF/Word document submitted or provided as a download link.

### Part 2: Pitch Video

Your team's task is to create a 10-minute video demonstrating your final artefact and pitching the concept behind it. The video should be well-prepared, with excellent production quality, and use well-designed slides explaining your ideas and research (cited in Harvard format), alongside footage of your artefact accompanied by a voice-over explanation. The pitch should be thoughtfully targeted towards a specific audience — such as angel investors, game publishers, a government body, or industry representatives. In Week 10, you will have a unique chance to present your work to an industry panel.
