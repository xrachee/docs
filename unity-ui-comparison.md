- So far from the documentation it looks like a lot of critical functions are still missing from UI Toolkit. People on the Unity reddit mentioned that it was launched in 2019 and still hasnâ€™t been given any needed major improvements
- For more functionality I personally think we should stick with uGUI to save us the frustration of being limited with features
